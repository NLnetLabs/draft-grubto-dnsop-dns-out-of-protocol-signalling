                     DNS Out Of Protocol Signalling
          draft-grubto-dnsop-dns-out-of-protocol-signalling-01

Abstract

   This document seeks to specify a method for name servers to signal
   programs outside of the name server software, and which are not
   necessarily involved with the DNS protocol, about conditions that can
   arise within the name server.  These signals can be used to invoke
   actions in areas that help provide the DNS service, such as routing.

   Currently this document serves as a requirements document to come to
   a signalling mechanism that will suit the use cases best.  Part of
   that effort is to assemble a list of conditions with potential
   associated out of DNS protocol actions, as well as inventory and
   assess existing signalling mechanisms for suitability.

Internet-Draft                  dns-oops                      March 2023


1.  Introduction

   Operators of name servers can benefit from automatically taking
   action upon certain conditions in the name server software.  Some
   conditions can be monitored from outside the name server software,
   but for adequate and immediate action, the name server software can
   signal itself about the condition immediately when it occurs to
   invoke action by a listener for these signals.

   An example of such a condition is when all zones, from a set served
   from an anycasted prefix, are loaded and ready to be served, with the
   associated automatic actions to only announce a prefix route from the
   point-of-presence where the name server is running, if all zones from
   the set are ready to be served, and to withdraw the prefix route if
   one of the zones cannot be served.  This way queries for zones will
   only reach the point-of-presence if the name server software can
   answer those queries.

   Operators of anycasted DNS authoritative services with diverse
   implementations will benefit from standardizing of the name server
   signalling, but before coming to a specification for the mechanism,
   this document will serve to inventorise the already available
   standardized and non-standardized signalling channels and assess them
   for usability for out of protocol signalling.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Conditions to be signalled

   This section served to collect a list of conditions for which actions
   outside of the DNS protocol may be interesting.  It is by no means
   meant to be a complete list, but serves to inventorise the
   requirements for the signalling channel.

3.1.  The name server is running and can respond to queries

3.2.  All zones are loaded and ready to serve

   Action:

   *  Start announcing the prefix on which these zones are served with
      BGP.

Internet-Draft                  dns-oops                      March 2023


3.3.  A zone is loaded and ready to serve

   Action:

   *  Start announcing the prefix on which this zone is served with BGP.

3.4.  A zone is updated to a new version

   Action:

   *  Verify the zone content.  Is it DNSSEC valid, does the ZONEMD
      validate.

3.5.  A zone is (about to) expire

   The period before expiration may be configurable.  A value of 0 will
   emit the signal the moment the zone expires.

   Action:

   *  Stop the BGP announcement of the prefix on which the zone is
      served.  It may be reannounced when the zone becomes available
      again (See Section 3.2).

3.6.  DNSSEC signatures are (about to) expire

   The period before expiration may be configurable.  A value of 0 will
   emit the signal the DNSSEC signature expires.

   Action:

   *  Stop the BGP announcement of the prefix on which the zone is
      served.  It may be reannounced when the zone becomes DNSSEC valid
      again (See Section 3.7).

3.7.  DNSSEC signatures will no longer expire soon

   Action:

   *  Start announcing the prefix on which this zone is served with BGP.

3.8.  Query rate is exceeding a threshold

   Action:

   *  Lengthen the AS path for the BGP announcement for a prefix, to
      demotivate the anycast node that receives all the queries.

   *  Or if the query rate is indicating a denial of service attack,
      keep the BGP AS path short, to absorb the attack.

3.9.  Query rate is below a threshold again

   Action:

   *  Recover from the measures taken in Section 3.8

3.10.  Extended DNS Error conditions

   Action:

   *  Dependent on the DNS Error condition

4.  Requirements for signalling mechanisms and channels

   The following requirements can be distilled from Section 3.

5.  Existing signalling mechanisms and channels

   What follows is a list of existing signalling mechanisms assessed on
   their suitability based on the requirements outlined in the previous
   paragraph.

5.1.  Notify

   [RFC1996]

5.2.  Extended DNS Error reporting

   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-error-reporting]

5.3.  D-Bus as publication channel

   [D-Bus]

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   Signalling MUST be performed in an authenticated and private manner.

7.  Implementation Status

   *  Knot DNS has support for D-Bus notifications (See Section 5.3) for
      significant server and zone events with the "dbus-event"
      configuration parameter since version 3.1.6 [Knot-DNS-3.1.6]
