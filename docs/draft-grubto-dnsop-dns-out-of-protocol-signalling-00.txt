                     DNS Out Of Protocol Signalling
          draft-grubto-dnsop-dns-out-of-protocol-signalling-00

Abstract

   This document seeks to specify a method for name servers to signal
   programs outside of the name server software, and which are not
   necessarily involved with the DNS protocol, about conditions that can
   arise within the name server.  These signals can be used to invoke
   actions in areas that help provide the DNS service, such as routing.

   Currently this document serves as a requirements document to come to
   a signalling mechanism that will suit the use cases best.  Part of
   that effort is to assemble a list of conditions with potential
   associated out of DNS protocol actions, as well as inventory and
   assess existing signalling mechanisms for suitability.

1.  Introduction

   Operators of name servers can benefit from automatically taking
   action upon certain conditions in the name server software.  Some
   conditions can be monitored from outside the name server software,
   but for adequate and immediate action, the name server software can
   signal itself about the condition immediately when it occurs to
   invoke action by a listener for these signals.

   An example of such a condition is when all zones, from a set served
   from an anycasted prefix, are loaded and ready to be served, with the
   associated automatic actions to only announce a prefix route from the
   point-of-presence where the name server is running, if all zones from
   the set are ready to be served, and to withdraw the prefix route if
   one of the zones cannot be served.  This way queries for zones will
   only reach the point-of-presence if the name server software can
   answer those queries.

   Operators of anycasted DNS authoritative services with diverse
   implementations will benefit from standardizing of the name server
   signalling, but before coming to a specification for the mechanism,
   this document will serve to inventorise the already available
   standardized and non-standardized signalling channels and assess them
   for usability for out of protocol signalling.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Conditions to be signalled

   This section served to collect a list of conditions for which actions
   outside of the DNS protocol may be interesting.  It is by no means
   meant to be a complete list, but serves to inventorise the
   requirements for the signalling channel.

3.1.  The name server is running and can respond to queries

3.2.  A zone is updated to a new version

3.3.  A zone is loaded and ready to be served

3.4.  A zone is about to expire

3.5.  A zone can no longer be served

3.6.  A zone from a set of zones is loaded and ready to be served

3.7.  One or more zones from a set of zones is about to expire

3.8.  One or more zones from a set of zones is no longer about to expire

3.9.  One or more zones from a set of zones can no longer be served

3.10.  Query rate is exceeding a threshold

3.11.  Query rate is below a threshold

3.12.  DNSSEC signatures are about to expire

3.13.  DNSSEC signatures will no longer expire soon

3.14.  Extended DNS Error conditions

4.  Requirements for signalling mechanisms and channels

   The following requirements can be distilled from Section 3.

5.  Existing signalling mechanisms and channels

   What follows is a list of existing signalling mechanisms assessed on
   their suitability based on the requirements outlined in the previous
   paragraph.

5.1.  Notify

   [RFC1996]

5.2.  Extended DNS Error reporting

   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-error-reporting]

5.3.  D-Bus as publication channel
